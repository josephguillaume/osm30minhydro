OSM 30min hydro
===============

A concordance dataset aiming to link 30 arcmin hydrological drainage direction maps with Wikidata items, Wikipedia pages and their Openstreetmap geometries.

The matches between datasets should be considered approximate. 30arcmin is relatively coarse, so multiple rivers often flow within single grid cells, and the raster representation often oversimplifies the shape of the river's catchment.

Potential uses:
* Interpret raster drainage direction maps in terms of real world features
* Identify limitations of drainage maps in representing real world features
* Encourage development of catchment hydrological and water resource descriptions on Wikipedia
* Encourage coverage of rivers in Openstreetmap
* Encourage uniform spatial coverage of rivers globally

Contribute:
* Correct errors or add missing data
* Edit Wikipedia pages
* Edit Wikidata items
* Complete or edit Openstreetmap geometries
* Add waterway relations and wikidata tags to Openstreetmap
